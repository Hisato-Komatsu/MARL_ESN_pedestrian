# MARL_ESN_pedestrian

Source codes for "Multi-agent reinforcement learning using echo-state network and its application to pedestrian dynamics".

Requires numpy, scipy, and Pillow.

Note: Codes of deep reinforcement learning(DRL) algorithms stored in 'DRL_algorithms' requires Pytorch, instead of scipy.

Most of hyperparameters are given in class 'hyperparameters'.

Whether parameter sharing is adopted or not is decided by Env.experience_sharing.

# updates
